# Dattebayo! A forum-based, play-by-post Naruto RPG

Dattebayo! is a Play-by-Post RPG that extends the universe of Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto.

Play-by-post RPGs are online versions of tabletop role-playing games, where players take on the roles of characters and participate in a story that is written collaboratively through a series of posts in a forum or on a message board. Each player takes turns making posts that describe the actions and decisions of their character, and the story progresses as players respond to each other's posts. This format allows for a more leisurely pace and a more detailed, text-based form of role-playing than is possible in real-time games.'
